# Project Architecture: LogTailer CLI

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD (Replace with actual date)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture for `LogTailer`, a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for real-time monitoring of log files. It allows users to tail multiple files, apply filters, highlight keywords, and customize output. **It provides project-specific technical guidelines, patterns, and examples, aligning with the general principles set forth in `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md`.**

## 2. Guiding Principles (from `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md`)

The architectural choices in this document are guided by the core principles outlined in the project's `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md` document, including but not limited to:

*   Readability
*   Simplicity (KISS)
*   Correctness
*   Robustness
*   Maintainability
*   Testability
*   Consistency
*   Function/Method Conciseness
*   DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Refer to `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md` for the full definitions of these principles.
