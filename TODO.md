- CLIPPY.md: Define a mandatory verification procedure after user confirms completion of a requested manual edit. This procedure should involve the AI re-reading the modified file and performing a full verification (akin to Step 4.4 Post-Apply Verification, including `Procedure: Verify Diff`) to confirm the manual edit achieved the intended outcome and introduced no new issues before proceeding with any subsequent steps.
- CLIPPY.md: Enhance `Procedure: Request Manual Edit` to ensure that code snippets provided to the user for manual application are optimally formatted for clarity and direct copy-pasting. The snippet should be a single, self-contained block, use precise context lines, clearly delineate existing vs. new code (`// ... existing code ...`), and be accompanied by unambiguous instructions on where and how to apply it (e.g., "replace lines X-Y with the following:", "insert after line Z:").
- CLIPPY.md: Introduce a new step or sub-section immediately before the current Step 6 (Summarize Deferred Observations). This new step should require the AI to generate a concise "Summary of Achievements" for the current task cycle, outlining the primary goals accomplished, key features implemented/modified, and significant refactoring work completed successfully.
- CLIPPY.md: Investigate and implement safeguards in CLIPPY.md to prevent the AI from erroneously embedding its own narrative, explanatory text, or commentary (intended for the user message) directly inside the code_edit string passed to the edit_file tool. This error causes the narrative text to be treated as code by the editing tool, leading to corrupted file changes and syntax errors. The goal is to ensure the code_edit parameter only contains the intended code changes and necessary context markers (like // ... existing code ...).
- no maximum for apply/reapply atemmpts but maybe a minimum. stop at own discretion.
- remove code instead of comment out. teh apply tool/ai has a etendecy to sommt out code instead of actually removing it.
- 4.4.1 Verify Edit Application: b. Post-edit_file Verification: -> make the branch better. this looks like "a" was skipped.
- consisten enforcement levels. (mus, crritical, etc)
- emphasize autonomy. no need to check in with user for every single thing. only check in when you have to.
- PLan is often too specific and teher are conflicts with thed details in the plan and then clippy gets into conflict with teh actual codebase. PLAN only describe high-level concept with no or minimal code. let let clippy decide on the actual implementation based on the codebase and the task at hand.
- better context for maunal edit requets. should include line numbers and context before and after.
