# Beat the Books - Development Standards and Requirements

**ATTENTION AI ASSISTANT: The following Core Principles are paramount and MUST be adhered to strictly in all circumstances. Violations, especially of the 'Work with Facts' principle (e.g., making assumptions, guessing, or introducing fallbacks based on errors instead of verifying root causes and requirements), are critical failures and must be avoided.**

## Core Principles

- **Complete & Integrated Implementation:**
    - Aim for complete and robust solutions that address all directly related aspects of a requested change, ensuring proper integration and adherence to architectural principles, not just the minimal fix.
- **Work with Facts:**
    - Implement based *only* on specified requirements or approved proposals. *Suggest* potential improvements, necessary deviations, or alternative approaches (based on broader knowledge or identified shortcomings) *for discussion and confirmation* before implementation.
    - Ask for clarification if information is missing; do not guess or make assumptions.
    - Do not introduce default values or fallback behaviors unless specifically required.
- **Critical Principle: Preserve Existing Functionality:** Modifications **MUST NOT** break or degrade existing core functionality. Proposed changes must be explicitly assessed for their impact on related components and data flows. Preventing regressions is paramount and takes precedence over expediency. Any change introducing a regression requires immediate remediation.
- **Consistency:**
    - Strongly prefer using patterns and libraries already present in the codebase to maintain consistency.
    - If a clearly superior alternative (new pattern, external library) exists, **propose its adoption with justification** rather than implementing it directly without approval.
- **Verification:**
    - Verify interface contracts before implementation.
    - Always read files before making edits.
- **Robust Solutions, Not Quick Fixes:**
    - Prioritize well-designed, maintainable, and correct code adhering to established best practices and architectural standards over temporary hacks, workarounds, or shortcuts that compromise quality or introduce technical debt.
- **Review Focus:**
    - When reviewing code: Focus on problematic issues rather than listing what's correct.

# NOTE: This document provides a concise checklist. Refer to code_architecture_standard.md for detailed explanations and examples.

## Debugging & Analysis
- **Traceback Analysis:** Prioritize obtaining and analyzing the full traceback when diagnosing errors. Leverage the existing logging setup, specifically using `logger.error(message, exc_info=True)` or its shorthand `logger.exception(message)`, to capture tracebacks effectively within `except` blocks and minimize guesswork.
- **Large File Handling:** When analyzing large files (especially JSON), prefer using command-line tools (e.g., `jq`, `cat`, `grep`, `less`) for inspection and querying rather than attempting to load the entire file into memory or an editor.

## Code Quality & Correctness

- **Strict Implementation:** 100% adherence to specifications and interfaces.
- **No Assumptions:** No fallbacks or defaults unless explicitly required.
- **Future Focus:** No backwards compatibility, no deprecation handling required.
- **DRY Principle:** No "Don't Repeat Yourself" violations. Verify no code reimplementation.
- **Cleanliness:** Clean up old/deprecated code during refactoring.
- **Integration:** Ensure refactors are well integrated and don't leave remnants.
- **Interface Matching:** Match async/sync method calls to interface definitions precisely. Validate parameter/return types against interfaces.
- **Typing:**
    - Strict Pydantic v2 compliance.
    - Use runtime-checkable Protocol classes for interfaces.
    - Follow Python typing best practices (use modern type annotations).
    - Use domain interfaces for type safety and dependency abstraction.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Implement proper error hierarchy and contextual error handling per domain context.
    - Use centralized utilities for common operations (including error patterns).
    - Implement comprehensive exception hierarchy.
- **Logging:** Ensure consistent usage of the logging module (configured and injected via DI).
- **Stateless Utilities:** Maintain pure, stateless, well-tested functions in dedicated utility modules/files.
- **Domain Models:** Maintain domain models as the single source of truth for all type definitions (enums, types, constants) used across the application. Import domain types/interfaces rather than redefining.

## Architecture & Design

- **Clear Boundaries:** Ensure sensible architecture design with clear boundaries (See `code_architecture_standard.md`).
- **Separation of Concerns:** Ensure clean separation between domain models, interfaces, and implementations.
- **Protocol-Based Interfaces:** Maintain protocol-based interfaces with clear contracts. Document interface method signatures and async/sync behavior.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Domain models must define all type definitions used across the application.
- **Facade Pattern:** Follow facade pattern for orchestration components.
- **Component Lifecycles:** Utilize the Dependency Injection (DI) container to manage component lifecycles (including Singleton scope where appropriate) instead of manual singletons.
- **Configuration:** Implement Upfront Configuration loading pattern (loading AppConfig once at startup via DI). (See `code_architecture_standard.md` Config Module section)

## Patterns & Practices

- **Dependency Injection (DI):**
    - Ensure proper DI as the primary mechanism for object creation and wiring. (See `code_architecture_standard.md` DI section).
    - Rely on DI container configuration (e.g., `providers.Dict`) for component mapping where possible, avoiding dedicated registries.
- **Factory/Registry:** Use dedicated Factory or Registry patterns **only** when the specific, stringent conditions outlined in `code_architecture_standard.md` are met.
- **Command Pattern:** Apply command pattern for CLI interactions (with commands resolved via DI).
- **Decorator Pattern:** Use decorator pattern judiciously for cross-cutting concerns (e.g., error handling, logging context).
- **Template Method:** Apply template method pattern for base implementations with standardized workflows.
- **Diagnostics:** Use diagnostic information pattern for collecting and propagating execution metrics.

## Module & File Structure

- **Standard Structure:** Maintain consistent standardized module structure (See `code_architecture_standard.md`).
- **Separation:** Ensure proper separation of base classes and implementations.
- **Domain Modules:** Follow domain module structure for core interfaces.
- **Component Folders:** Implement component-specific folder structure in each module (e.g., `strategies/`, `implementations/`).

## Testing

- **Contract Testing:** Test interface implementations against their defined contracts (`Protocol`s).
- **Comprehensive Tests:** Add appropriate tests (unit, integration, container tests verifying DI wiring).

## Implementation Workflow (Guide, Not Standard)

*Note: This workflow describes how to implement features, not strictly audit standards.*
1. Define necessary domain interfaces or use existing ones.
2. Implement components, ensuring they declare dependencies clearly in `__init__` for DI.
3. Register new components explicitly within the main DI container (`di.py`).
4. Import domain types/interfaces rather than redefining.
5. Cross-reference interfaces before implementing methods.
6. Add appropriate tests.

Document each step with what is being done and why.
