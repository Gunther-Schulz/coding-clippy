**Procedure:** A set of steps to follow to achieve a specific goal.
**Reapply:** The process of applying a previously verified edit to the code.
**Reusable Verification Procedure:** A procedure that can be used multiple times to verify different aspects of the code.
**Root Cause:** The underlying reason for an error or problem.
**SHOULD:** Indicates a recommendation that is expected to be followed unless a valid reason exists in the specific circumstances to deviate. (Inspired by RFC 2119)
