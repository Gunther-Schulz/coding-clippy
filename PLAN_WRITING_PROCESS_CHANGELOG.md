## v1.1 - 2025-05-04

*   **Language-Agnostic Refactoring:**
    *   Generalized language-specific examples and terminology (imports/dependencies, errors, file conventions, specific model/library mentions) throughout the document.
    *   Updated references to `code_architecture_standard.md` to emphasize it contains language/framework-specific details.
    *   Focused descriptions on the *intent* of checks (dependency validation, interface consistency, logic preservation, etc.) rather than specific language mechanisms.
    *   Set initial version number.
